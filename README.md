# my-go-template

A template for starting development with Go

## Getting Started

When you use this template, please replace `my-go-template` with your own project name.
You can find where `my-go-template` is used by running the following command:

```bash
grep -rn "my-go-template" . --exclude-dir={.git,dist,bin}
```

We also recommend that you remove `go.mod` and `go.sum` once and run `go mod init` again.
